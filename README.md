# Ingredient-to-Meal-Planner

## About
This app will help the user decide on a meal to cook and prepare based on the ingredients on hand! The user can save ingredients that they own on an ingredient list and use the app to generate recipes based on those ingredients. The app will search a large database of recipes and return the requested amount of recipes to the user. They can even sort the recipes to show recipes that are missing the least amount of ingredients first!
